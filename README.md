This is the code for the blog post I wrote about using AngularJS, SCSS and Twitter Bootstrap to rapidly prototype user experiences. You can read the post [here.](http://cattsmall.com/2014/05/using-angularjs-scss-and-twitter-bootstrap-to-rapidly-prototype-user-experiences/)

Feel free to fork my code and tinker with it. [You can see the prototype here](http://cattsmall.github.io/Angular_Bootstrap_UX_Prototyping/).
